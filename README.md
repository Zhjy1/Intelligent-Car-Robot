# Face Detection and Human Tracking Robot

It is a MathWorks Project named "Face-Detection-and-Human-Tracking-Robot-main" in 2022. The project is mainly collaborated by zhou Junyu, Guo Lancong and Liu Jinfan. Our project obtained the excellence in innovation certificate by MathWorks. 

We designed an intelligent car robot which has three essential modules: face recognition, speech recognition, GSP navigation and localization.

We first used Raspberry Pi to build a face recognition system based on the camera of an Android phone, which has a accurate and fast recognition ability and can use a mask to determine the location of the human face.In addition, we also designed a motion control algorithm for the car based on the face recognition system so that it can move towards the location of the person.

Besides, we also integrated a speech recognition module so that the car can complete the movement operation according to the voice command.

Moreover, we designed the GSP navigation and localization program for the car based on MATLAB Mobile, so that it can travel along the preset GSP localization routes.

The intelligent car robot can be used in certain large venues such as square cabin hospitals, isolated hotels, restaurants or other environments, specifically to realize the distribution of supplies, meals, medicines and so on. It can effectively prevent the spread of disease, and at the same time can greatly reduce labor costs.

The functionality of this car robot is yet to be improved. Welcome for discussions and exchanges.
